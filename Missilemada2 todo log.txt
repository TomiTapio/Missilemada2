Missilemada 2: place mining ship, place defender ship, place scout ship(scan for asteroids and foes, also combat), place attack cruiser (hinder enemy mining, quite expensive)
4 resource types from 5 types of asteroids: fuel, metal1, metal2, metal3, useless. Okay maybe aste can give 2 things at once.


Maybe defe ship can place mines. Nah, space is too large.
--done??-- Maybe atk cruiser is so big it can repair other ships.

WORLD:
5000 000 km diameter region, use DOUBLE. -2500 000 to 2500 000. (Saturn's rings is 60 000 + 80 000 km from Saturn core, so 2x 140Mm)
31 km/sec UNACCEPTABLE coz only 45h edge to edge.
Want 30*(300 sec) = 9000 ticks edge to edge. 9000 * 5min tick is 750h. Means speed of 6666 kph = x m/s.

MAYBE space whales (a type of weaponless ship, flees always, whale faction...... sigh) 
NOPE energy beings, 
MAYBE mapwide wavefronts of destruction (all scouts to 10% HP)
MAYBE Sensor anomaly = is nothing, but Scouts go check. 

DONE: ini file: plr start reso, enemy resources.
DONE: ini file: Base move speed.
DONE: is_drone func. 
DONE? Manned not accept a drone as buddy.
DONE: Drone accept only manned buddy. 
DONE: UI button list. Dot draw, dot was this clicked coords. AddUIButton(text, x, y, width, height, bool draw border) 
DONE. misl turning TOO MUCH coz 30-900 seconds tick!
DONE: Move clear screen to before advance time. Then use sensors can draw ping lines.
DONE: How visualize sensor range. draw DISC, wireframe, outermost only.
DONE: Draw line to buddy, or to follow-stronger. Too spammy, disabled.

DONE: Boom on plr ship loss.
DONE: Capture enemy ships that have engine & sensors damage! (execute crew) 
DONE: Let do immediate ship building. Ships sit there doing nothing until their timer ding. 
DONE: COUNTER: CREW AVAILABLE AT BASE. ("Commander, the stealth shuttle has brought 5 more men to the base!")

- Arrow on BASE to indicate that combat in direction X. 
- Arrow on BASE to indicate that wantedmetal asteroid is thataway. or green special-line to it. 
- Faction have last spotted foe location? Shift frontline towards, until frontline X away from base. OR until FL is X near to last_spotted.

-UI buttons: scoutrange up/down.
-if to-scout spot WAY FAR from curr location, don't accept, req new one until reasonable dist from self_spot.
-HUD msg: first time we spotted an enemy.
-once misldrone has volley off, forcedesti away
-- maybe: before firing missile, compare self misl spd to foe spd, and dist to foe...
--missile.setowner(ship) IF game has a missile hacking feature. El cheapo missiles suck! but they would be low fuel and probably not reach foe after hacking. 
-----if fac has wanted amounts of ships already, THEN WHAT PRODUCE? Incr want count of WHICH? Defender.



--HAZARDZONES! isDestiInsideHazard(), isDestiInsideDAMAGINGHazard(), for mydetectedhazardslist do adjustDestiAwayFromHZCenter(Vector desti, Hazard hazard1).

__fixed? public Asteroid chooseKnownAsteroidToMine(String whatkind, Ship asker) { //xxxxxxxxxxtook 33% of cpu time duing big battle!!!!
done: ship keeps track how many misl have hit it.
==If took hull hit and damage number greater than 8th of hull, set one system to broken. Coz small ship.

__maybe no foe after scen2 starts after win scen1..
__ on ship creation, a "Notes" stringbuffer that has builder dudes' notes like "slow model, so extra shields". But where to show it?
--starbase instaheals itself coz near itself??

done: scenariofile: playersensorboost=x, AIsensorboost=y

__ new shiptype: disabler (ion cannon, EMP, messes enemy moving and sh-regen and sensors) (lesser defender, 2 crew. few missiles, no defbeam/atkbeam, ion shot takes 25% of shield)

done: fix nullptr, if the ships-camera ship died...
__ faction aggression: 0[flee when see 1 foe or 2 misl] 0 to 11. On AI, random. On player, set via gui buttons. This makes it easier for player to make mistakes.

---vfx that has xy bearing, for ARROW POINTING gfx.

rejected: Crew promotions? Nah.
done: Base put dudes in ships.
rejected: Low-manned new ships when base low of crew_available? Nah, zaibatsu policy forbids.

Miner get 1 merit every 800? Tons delivered. 
Tiny drone, scout size smaller, only does Missile defense beam. No shields.
Missile drone, 80%of scout, no shields, no beam, bad engine, good sensors.

done: Start World: N asteroids, and one starbase per faction.
Plasma storm hinder sensors and movement.
Ion cloud hinder sensors.
Aste blows up unexpectedly.
Special resource pickup: ship debris, metal 1 2 3.
done: plr can decide what kind of ship to build
: and what aste to mine
: and what defe ships where.
Player can only move camera to places that are within own fac ships sensors! This prevents infinite viewing.

Lose condition: foes kill your starbase.
Win condition: kill all foe starbases, or conquer them, or have N more combat ships than foes. 



NOPE: plr can take command of scout and AC. Not miner or defe.
--maybe plr can create ship formations.

DONE:draw sensor range orb.
----if have missiles, if fired them all, goto self.fallback position.
--if camera too far, don't draw texts.
done:----maybe atan2 is FUCKED because no longer in awt-2D engine coords? but was fine earlier and for ships?nope.
----stars/nebula background pic: SET EMISSION ONLY.
done:-- why base no spew missiles???
---try base vs base only -battle!
--if first good mining you find is near enemy base, YOU ARE GAMEOVER SCREWED...

asteroids move very slowly, can gently bump each other? Ships never collide with asteroids because advanced ships.

Milestone: found one enemy starbase.
Milestone: destroyed 3 enemy scouts.
Milestone: destroyed 3 enemy miners.
Milestone: destroyed 1 AC.
Minestone: destroyed 1 starbase.

DONE: StartWorld(int num_factions, int distance betw bases, int num aste, worldtimeincrement)



TIME SCALE AND BATTLE: must be longer than MMada1... 1 hour tick is SHIT for missiles and beam attacks, but good for mining and flight distances. Drop to 15sec scale when battle?
mine & travel: 5min ticks. combat: 5sec ticks.
travel time in hours from one Base to Base?? 30 ticks per player_second, 3hrs ship_flight in plr_sec... 300hrs in 100 plr_sec
BATTLE is non-interactive to PLAYER! No input while battle! Just animation showing what happened. Popup of damage taken, damage dealt, did who flee, did who blew up, did we salvage-convert.
maybe later (MM2 v1.5) could have a mini-game of the formation-vs-formation battles.
salvage-convert: no need for crewman, repair engine, set robo-autopilot so the converted one goes to our base for refit.



GRAPHICS IDEAS: ship = transparent textured elongated sphere, shows other texture sphere beneath.
asteroid = Custom sphere func with randomness in points. Elongated or not. 
starbase = huge spherical ship.
missile = elongated non-textured sphere, or cylinder+cylinder <>.
atk beam = emission-type material on cylinder! Maybe some texture, hexadecimal or squiggles.
defe beam = other color atk beam, no texture.
repair happening = flatsprite facing camera.
resource coming off asteroid = flatsprite facing camera.
resource from mining ship to base = 
ene ship converted and repaired =
ship explodes = 10 flatsprites? Some debris spheres or cubes, emission-glowing.

SHIP:
"the Space Shuttle top speed is always around 17,500 miles per hour" so let's 4x that for out slowest ship = 70k MPH = 112654 kph.
ship.useSensors()
ship.decideGoal() {remember distances to base, friends, foes, foe base....} MODE: go repair a base, mine, scout, flee, attack, defend(stay close to weakest buddy), patrol(scout but only near friendly ships)

ship.repairAtBase(boolean i am convertee) {unload cargo,repair, pick up some reso if are AC and gonna salvage-convert foes.}
ship.advancetime() { recharge shields and weapons, use sens, decide, use weap, move(), crewRepair() }

DONE: ship catch fire (continuous hull & system damage until rand chance. Rand chance of crew death), limps back to base. woo! SBase also catch fire.
DONE: ships have a crew count. Crew to zero means autopilot to base, . (crew zero and engines <50% == kapow)
todo VERY vulne to capture while
done: ship systems have repair percentages. Sensors to zero, engine to zero, life support to zero... misl system, shie system, defe system, mining system
done: ship gets hit: rand chance of system damage(33%) and crew death(7%).
done: system repairs: 1% chance of 5% sysrepair per crewman, per (5m tick) (first life supp, then engines, then sensors, then shie, weap, hull, mining) (cargo bay damage is nothing, easy to re-pick-up fallen ore)

onmouseover, ship numbers info panel. cargo(resources), crew count.
done: hull repair at base, or at atk cruiser.

Mining ship when full, fly to home base. 
Mining ship: buddy is mining ship.
Defe ship: buddy is mining ship.
Scout ship: buddy is scout or atk cruiser.
AC: buddy is AC.

done: Convert enemy ships! 
rejected: Defe or atk ship use N of their carried resources to convert foe ship that surrendered.		

Ship stats: hull, shie,   missiles, atk beam, defe beam,   crew count. speed.

Price: Four scout is price of one miner. 2.8 scout is defe. 3.2 miners is AC. 

Future: atk scout, doublegood defender, doublegood miner 
speed: defender speed is realworld shuttle x 5.
beam str also defines its reach?
defe beam needs rarest metal3? Shie needs metal2, Hull needs metal1. Misl capability needs 1 2 fuel.
maybe: Would the ships need to refuel at base?? Pick up more missiles??
Miner: (cargo capacity N tons, 1600 tons one 10x10x4m cargo bay) (one cube is 4-6 tons)

Ship dot accelerate towards xyz. Kinetic energy vs engine power over time tick duration, MJoules.


FACTION:
fac.issueFactionCommand(str). all_to_base, all_to_defend_miners, all_scout_AC_attack, all_scout_defe_AC_attack, 
fac.produceship(str whichtype)
fac.getScore() shipbuildcosts + resources + territory

So, faction has a b c d ship counts and x y z q resource counts. Buy ships, place ships.
Faction has knowledge of mining locations (decide what aste to mine next) and foes (if X resources, send atk&scout&defe to enemy location)
Fac has list of known enemy locations!
Fac has list of known good asteroid locations!

What makes factions different? Build bias  0.5--4.0
(2.0 mine, 0.5 defe, 2.0 scout, 0.5 AC)
(1.5 mine, 1.5 defe, 0.7 scout, 0.8 AC)
(1.0 mine, 0.5 defe, 2.7 scout, 1.3 AC)
or aggression (how soon pick a fight) (choose aste near or far from foe). Battle Confidence, Mining Boldness/Timidness.
Faction params from a rand string?!? 
Play faction melody on ship production, and reso dropped at base, and ship convert.

Faction start with base, miner, defe, scout. 
Faction send scout/attackforce that direction. Or near that aste. Or away/toward from known foe. area.
Faction dot create fleet. 

Faction set miner priority. Fuel metal 1 metal 2.
Faction send miner to known asteroid. Maybe miner decision making is minimal. To asteroid, to base.
